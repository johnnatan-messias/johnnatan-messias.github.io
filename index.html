												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies liquid
													staking tokens (LSTs) on automated market makers (AMMs), both
													theoretically and empirically. LSTs are tokenized representations of
													staked assets on proof-of-stake blockchains. First, we model
													LST-liquidity on AMMs theoretically, categorizing suitable AMM
													types for LST liquidity and deriving formulas for the necessary
													returns from trading fees to adequately compensate liquidity
													providers under the particular price trajectories of LSTs. For the
													latter, two relevant metrics are considered: (1) losses compared
													to holding the liquidity outside the AMM (loss-versus-holding, or
													"impermanent loss"), and (2) the relative profitability compared to
													fully staking the capital (loss-versus-staking) which is
													specifically tailored to the case of LST-liquidity. Next, we
													empirically measure these metrics for Ethereum LSTs across the most
													relevant AMM pools. We find that, while trading fees often
													compensate for impermanent loss, fully staking is more profitable
													for many pools, raising questions about the sustainability of the
													current LST liquidity allocation to AMMs.

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> This paper explores the dynamics
													of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) within the Layer-2 ecosystem,
													focusing on Automated Market Makers (AMM) and arbitrage on Ethereum
													rollups. We observe significant shifts in trading activity from
													Ethereum to rollups, with swaps on rollups happening 2-3 times more
													often, though, with lower trade volume. By examining the price
													differences between AMMs and centralized exchanges, we discover over
													0.5 million unexploited arbitrage opportunities on rollups.
													Remarkably, we observe that these opportunities last, on average, 10
													to 20 blocks, requiring adjustments to the LVR metrics to avoid
													double-counting arbitrage. Our results show that arbitrage in
													Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism pools ranges from 0.03% to 0.05% of
													trading volume, while in zkSync Era it oscillates around 0.25%, with
													the LVR metric overestimating arbitrage by a factor of five. Rollups
													offer not only lower gas fees, but also provide faster block
													production, leading to significant differences compared to the
													trading and arbitrage dynamics of Ethereum.

											<div id="arxiv-inscriptions" class="collapse">
												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Despite the level of attention
													given to rollups there is limited empirical research about their
													performance. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive
													data-driven analysis of the late 2023 transaction boom that is
													attributed to inscriptions: a novel approach to record data onto a
													blockchain with no outside server needed. Inscriptions were first
													introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain to allow for the representation
													of NFTs or ERC-20-like tokens without smart contracts, but were
													later spread to other blockchains.
													This work examines the applications of inscription transactions in
													Ethereum and its major EVM-compatible rollups and their impact on
													blockchain scalability during periods of sudden transaction surges.
													We found that on certain days, inscription-related transactions
													comprised over 89% on Arbitrum, over 88% on zkSync Era, and over 53%
													on Ethereum. Furthermore, 99% of these transactions were related to
													the minting of meme coins, followed by limited trading activity.
													Unlike L1 blockchains, during periods of transaction surges, zkSync
													and Arbitrum experienced lower median gas fees, attributable to the
													compression of L2 transactions for a single L1 batch. Additionally,
													zkSync Era, a ZK rollup, demonstrated a stronger reduction in fees
													than optimistic rollups considered in our study: Arbitrum, Base, and
													Optimism.

													in. We then analyze on-chain data from several larger-scale airdrops
													to empirically evaluate the success of previous airdrops, with
													respect to our desiderata. In our analysis, we demonstrate that

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Smart contracts are contractual
													agreements between participants of a blockchain, who cannot
													implicitly trust one another. They are software programs that run on
													top of a blockchain, and we may need to change them from time to
													time (e.g., to fix bugs or address new use cases). Governance
													protocols define the means for amending or changing these smart
													contracts without any centralized authority. They distribute instead
													the decision-making power to every user of the smart contract: Users
													vote on accepting or rejecting every change. The focus of this work
													is to evaluate whether, how, and to what extent these protocols
													ensure decentralized governance, the fundamental tenet of
													blockchains, in practice. This evaluation is crucial as smart
													contracts continue to transform our key, traditional, centralized
													institutions, particularly banking and finance.
													In this work, we review and characterize decentralized governance in
													practice, using Compound -- one of the widely used governance
													protocols -- as a case study. We reveal a high concentration of
													voting power in Compound: 10 voters hold together 57.86% of the
													voting power. Although proposals to change or amend the protocol
													(or, essentially, the application they support) receive, on average,
													a substantial number of votes (i.e., 89.39%) in favor, they require
													fewer than three voters to obtain 50% or more votes. We show that
													voting on Compound governance proposals can be unfairly expensive
													for small token holders, and also discover voting coalitions that
													can further marginalize these users. We plan on publishing our
													scripts and data set on GitHub to support reproducible research.

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> In permissionless
													blockchains, transaction issuers include a fee to incentivize
													miners to include their transaction. To accurately estimate this
													prioritization fee for a transaction, transaction issuers (or
													blockchain participants, more generally) rely on two fundamental
													notions of transparency, namely contention and prioritization
													transparency. Contention transparency implies that participants
													are aware of every pending transaction that will contend with a
													given transaction for inclusion. Prioritization transparency
													states that the participants are aware of the transaction or
													prioritization fees paid by every such contending transaction.
													Neither of these notions of transparency holds well today.
													Private relay networks, for instance, allow users to send
													transactions privately to miners. Besides, users can offer fees
													to miners via either direct transfers to miners' wallets or
													off-chain payments---neither of which are public. In this work,
													we characterize the lack of contention and prioritization
													transparency in Bitcoin and Ethereum resulting from such
													practices. We show that private relay networks are widely used
													and private transactions are quite prevalent. We show that the
													lack of transparency facilitates miners to collude and
													overcharge users who may use these private relay networks
													despite them offering little to no guarantees on transaction
													prioritization. The lack of these transparencies in blockchains
													has crucial implications for transaction issuers as well as the
													stability of blockchains. Finally, we make our data sets and

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Most public blockchain
													protocols, including the popular Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains,
													do not formally specify the order in which miners should select
													transactions from the pool of pending (or uncommitted) transactions
													for inclusion in the blockchain. Over the years, informal
													conventions or "norms" for transaction ordering have, however,
													emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the
													GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a
													widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions
													based on their offered "transaction fee-per-byte." Bitcoin users
													are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the
													commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of
													congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and
													present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating
													from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for
													which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received
													dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As
													blockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping
													substrate for a variety of decentralized (financial technology)

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> We study efficiency in a
													proof-of-work blockchain with non-zero latencies, focusing in
													particular on the (inequality in) individual miners' efficiencies.
													Prior work attributed differences in miners' efficiencies mostly to
													attacks, but we pursue a different question: Can inequality in
													miners' efficiencies be explained by delays, even when all miners
													are honest? Traditionally, such efficiency-related questions were
													tackled only at the level of the overall system, and in a
													peer-to-peer (P2P) setting where miners directly connect to one
													another. Despite it being common today for miners to pool compute
													capacities in a mining pool managed by a centralized coordinator,
													efficiency in such a coordinated setting has barely been studied.
													In this paper, we propose a simple model of a proof-of-work
													blockchain with latencies for both the P2P and the coordinated
													settings. We derive a closed-form expression for the efficiency in
													the coordinated setting with an arbitrary number of miners and
													arbitrary latencies, both for the overall system and for each
													individual miner. We leverage this result to show that inequalities
													arise from variability in the delays, but that if all miners are
													equidistant from the coordinator, they have equal efficiency
													irrespective of their compute capacities. We then prove that, under
													a natural consistency condition, the overall system efficiency in
													the P2P setting is higher than that in the coordinated setting.
													Finally, we perform a simulation-based study to demonstrate that
													even in the P2P setting delays between miners introduce
													inequalities, and that there is a more complex interplay between
													delays and compute capacities.

													The low throughput (i.e., transactions committed per unit time) of

													In a month-long investigation of Bitcoin, we reveal that congestion
													(i.e., when there exist more transactions than can be

													significant variance during periods of congestion.
													Although the fee-per-byte dequeuing policy is widely considered the

													delay a significant fraction of transactions.
													Such deviations undermine the utility of blockchains for ensuring a

													the Brazilian presidential campaign. We analyze the types of content
													shared within such groups as well as the network structures that
													emerge from user interactions within and cross-groups. We then
													deepen our analysis by identifying the presence of misinformation
													among the shared images using labels provided by journalists and by

													Since targeted ads are not seen by non-targeted and non-vulnerable

													exploring the extent to which political ads from the Russian

													infrastructure to efficiently target ads on divisive
													or polarizing topics (e.g., immigration, race-based policing) at

													we do the following: (a) We conduct U.S. census-representative
													surveys to characterize how users with different

													<i>perceive truth in</i> the content of the IRA ads.
													Our surveys show that many ads are "divisive": they elicit very

													different socially salient groups. (b) We characterize how these
													divisive ads are targeted to sub-populations that

													how the Facebook ad API facilitates such targeting.
													We show how the enormous amount of personal data Facebook aggregates

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Users of social media sites like
													Facebook and Twitter rely on crowdsourced content recommendation
													systems (e.g., Trending
													Topics) to retrieve important and useful information. Contents
													selected for recommendation indirectly give
													the initial users who promoted (by liking or posting) the content an
													opportunity to propagate their messages
													to a wider audience. Hence, it is important to understand the
													demographics of people who make a content
													worthy of recommendation, and explore whether they are
													representative of the media site's overall population.
													In this work, using extensive data collected from Twitter, we make
													the first attempt to quantify and explore
													the demographic biases in the crowdsourced recommendations. Our
													analysis, focusing on the selection of
													trending topics, finds that a large fraction of trends are promoted
													by crowds whose demographics are significantly
													different from the overall Twitter population. More worryingly, we
													find that certain demographic groups
													are systematically under-represented among the promoters of the
													trending topics. To make the demographic

													preferences. In this paper, we present a large-scale
													measurement study focused on understanding how users control the
													longitudinal exposure of their publicly
													shared data on social media sites. Our study, using data from
													Twitter, finds that a significant fraction
													of users withdraw a surprisingly large percentage of old publicly
													shared data—more than 28% of 6-year old
													public posts (tweets) on Twitter are not accessible today. The
													inaccessible tweets are either selectively
													deleted by users or withdrawn by users when they delete or make
													their accounts private. We also found a
													significant problem with the current exposure control
													mechanisms—even when a user deletes her tweets or
													her account, the current mechanisms leave traces of residual
													activity, i.e., tweets from other users sent
													as replies to those deleted tweets or accounts still remain
													accessible. We show that using this residual
													information one can recover significant information about the
													deleted tweets or even characteristics of
													the deleted accounts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
													to study the information leakage resulting
													from residual activities of deleted tweets and accounts. Finally, we
													propose two exposure control mechanisms
													that eliminates information leakage via residual activities. One of
													our mechanisms optimize for allowing
													meaningful social interactions with user posts and another mechanism

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Recently, there have been
													considerable efforts to use online data to investigate international
													migration. These efforts show that Web data are valuable for
													estimating migration rates and are relatively
													easy to obtain. However, existing studies have only investigated
													flows of people along migration corridors,
													i.e. between pairs of countries. In our work, we use data about
													"places lived" from millions of Google+
													users in order to study migration "clusters", i.e. groups of
													countries in which individuals have lived.
													For the first time, we consider information about more than two
													countries people have lived in. We argue
													that these data are very valuable because this type of information
													is not available in traditional demographic
													sources which record country-to-country migration flows independent
													of each other. We show that migration
													clusters of country triads cannot be identified using information
													about bilateral flows alone. To demonstrate
													the additional insights that can be gained by using data about
													migration clusters, we first develop a model
													that tries to predict the prevalence of a given triad using only
													data about its constituent pairs. We then
													inspect the groups of three countries which are more or less
													prominent, compared to what we would expect
													based on bilateral flows alone. Next, we identify a set of features
													such as a shared language or colonial
													ties that explain which triple of country pairs are more or less
													likely to be clustered when looking at
													country triples. Then we select and contrast a few cases of clusters
													that provide some qualitative information
													about what our data set shows. The type of data that we use is
													potentially available for a number of social
													media services. We hope that this first study about migration
													clusters will stimulate the use of Web data
													for the development of new theories of international migration that
													could not be tested appropriately before.

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b>
													Blockchains revolutionized centralized sectors like banking and
													finance by promoting decentralization and transparency. In a
													blockchain, information is transmitted through transactions issued
													by participants or applications. Miners crucially select, order, and
													validate pending transactions for block inclusion, prioritizing
													those with higher incentives or fees. The order in which
													transactions are included can impact the blockchain final state.
													<br><br>Moreover, applications running on top of a blockchain often
													rely on governance protocols to decentralize the decision-making
													power to make changes to their core functionality. These changes can
													affect how participants interact with these applications. Since one
													token equals one vote, participants holding multiple tokens have a
													higher voting power to support or reject the proposed changes. The
													extent to which this voting power is distributed is questionable and
													if highly concentrated among a few holders can lead to governance
													attacks.
													<br><br>In this thesis, we audit the Bitcoin and Ethereum
													blockchains to investigate the norms followed by miners in
													determining the transaction prioritization. We also audit
													decentralized governance protocols such as Compound to evaluate
													whether the voting power is fairly distributed among the
													participants. Our findings have significant implications for future

												<p class="font-italic"><b>Abstract:</b> Social media is considered a
													democratic space in which people connect and interact with each
													other regardless of their gender, race, or any other demographic
													aspect. Despite numerous efforts that explore demographic aspects in
													social media, it is still unclear whether social media perpetuates
													old inequalities from the offline world. In this dissertation, we
													attempt to identify gender and race of Twitter users located in the
													United States using advanced image processing algorithms from
													Face++. We investigate how different demographic groups (i.e.
													male/female, asian/black/white) connect with each other and
													differentiate them regarding linguistic styles and also their
													interests. We quantify to what extent one group follows and
													interacts with each other and the extent to which these connections
													and interactions reflect in inequalities in Twitter. We also extract
													linguistic features from six categories (affective attributes,
													cognitive attributes, lexical density and awareness, temporal
													references, social and personal concerns, and interpersonal focus)
													in order to identify the similarities and the differences in the
													messages they share in Twitter. Furthermore, we extract the absolute
													ranking difference of top phrases between demographic groups. As a
													dimension of diversity, we also use the topics of interest that we
													retrieve from each user. Our analysis shows that users identified as
													white and male tend to attain higher positions, in terms of the
													number of followers and number of times in another user's lists, in
													Twitter. There are clear differences in the way of writing across
													different demographic groups in both gender and race domains as well
													as in the topic of interest. We hope our effort can stimulate the
													development of new theories of demographic information in the online
													space. Finally, we developed a Web-based system that leverages the
													demographic aspects of users to provide transparency to the Twitter
													trending topics system.

													development. The drones can be used in military services, for
													example, in combat or as well as for rescue missions, aerial survey,

													attention from media outlets such as, for example, television
													stations, radio, newspapers and internet. The goal of this project
													is whether it is possible to make viable autonomous flights at
													AR.Drone 2.0 and the understanding of its operation. This will
													require the implementation of a control program for autonomous
													flights. This framework requires the acquisition of data during the
													flight, which are obtained using sensors which use Arduino. The
													Arduino communication with the drone is needed for the inclusion of
													new sensors and the use of the AR.Drone is performed by the
													framework Node.js. Each remote button has a specific command, and
													may be in order for the user to create own missions or even perform
													some missions previously implemented by the developer. All tests
													were run on the AR.Drone 2.0, using the Node.js framework, sensors
													and a remote control. Through the experiments and presented studies
													became possible to achieve the proposed objective, making possible
													the implementation of autonomous flights in drone. As a result, for
													the realization of autonomous flight we designed a framework where
													the user can create autonomous flight missions for the drone run
													them. These commands are sent to the drone by the user due to use of
													a remote control. This remote control sends data to a sensor
													connected to the Arduino that processes the data and then is read
													and interpreted by the drone.
